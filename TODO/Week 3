Technologies and Concepts to figure out

Sensors
	-What sensors do we want to use?
	-How much power can we get from each sensor?
		-Does this scale linearly
	-How many sensors will we use?
	-How accurate/granular is the force measurement
	-How will sensors be arranged?
	-What forces can the sensor withstand?
	
Enery Harvester
	-What are the availaible energy harvesting chips
	-How much power does energy harvesting chips use
	-Does it only provide bursts of energy, or can it supply sustained energy
	-What kind of configuration would the sensors need to be in?
	-Does it need external components (capactitors?)
		-How many, and what size?
		
Energy Harvesting Alternatives
	-What can be used to supply power?
	-What are the power specs?
	-Does it need to recharge?
	-What is the size?
		
Microcontroller
	-Find microcontroller based on power supply?
	-How many ADC units?
	-size?
	-can pins be read in sleep mode?
	-how to program it?
	-cost?
	-Is bluetooth embedded?
	
Bluetooth Transmitters
	-Find available bluetooth chips
	-power consumption?
	-interface?
	-range?
	
Phone Service
	-What do we want the phone service to do
		-Send over wifi and/or LTE?
	-Just data relay, or should we do processing?
	-Can we send GPS data with the other data?
		-other possible data? acceleration, etc.
	-UI components?
	
Web Server
	-what sevice are we going to use to host our server?
	-What OS does it run?
	-cost?
	-How many processes can we run on it?
	-What software it supports
		-Can it run backend scripts in the language we want?
		
	backend
		-What backend framework should be used?
		-What kind of features do we want?
			-Does that change how we store/process data
		
	frontend
		-what front end framework should be used?
		-What is out UI going to look like

Database
	-What type of database we want to use for storing data	
		-timeseries
		-NoSQL or SQL
