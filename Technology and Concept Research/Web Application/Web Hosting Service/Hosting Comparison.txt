Web hosting capabilities vary a lot from service to service. Certain web hosting services may only support certain technologies, or
offer options where an environment can be customized, but for a large price. Based on the performed research, Heroku appears
to be the best option for active development. Many web hosting services can be found that are cheaper, but those are likley more
appropriate for production ready software. For the development of this project, Heroku offers an environment that not only supports
almost any language and framework, but also allows for 1000 hours of free development. This means that our application can be developed 
and tested without any price tag. Additionally, Heroku offers support for hosting Django and express projects - two of the backend
frameworks being considered for this project. In addition to the backend framework, our application will require a hosted database, 
something that Heroku supports. Heroku supports mySQL, postgres, and other databases that are not supported in hosting 
services such as hostgator, or firebase. Heroku also includes extensive, easy to navigate documentation which many of the other 
hosting services lack. Once the application is in it's final form, it can then be easily transfered over to a paid version of 
a Heroku service, which includes additional services such as free SSL and certificate management
